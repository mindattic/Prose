#Requires -Version 5.1

.SYNOPSIS
    Shuts down any running KdpPublish, clears build cache, rebuilds, and publishes a
    standalone copy to C:\Apps\KdpPublish\ — same process IdiotProof uses
    (tools/publish-all.ps1) to always have a fresh, independent deployed copy.

.DESCRIPTION
    1. Stops any running Prose.KdpPublish.exe process.
    2. Removes bin/obj for the KdpPublish + Core + Shared projects — a clean, timestamp-
       independent rebuild, not an incremental one. This is the BUILD cache only; the
       WebView2 user-data folders under %LocalAppData%\MindAttic\KdpPublish\ (which hold
       the KDP login session) are never touched, so the Amazon login survives redeploys.
    3. dotnet publish (Release, win-x64, framework-dependent single file) -> C:\Apps\KdpPublish\.
    4. Writes C:\Apps\KdpPublish\launch.bat. NOTE (changed from the original "fully
       standalone" design): launch.bat now calls this same deploy.ps1 (by its baked-in
       source path) EVERY time before launching, so a double-click always runs the
       current source rather than risking a stale deployed copy (see the RESIST incident
       memory — a 3-day-stale exe silently missing an entire feature). This means
       launch.bat now DEPENDS on the source repo existing at the path baked in at deploy
       time. If that path is missing (repo moved/deleted), it logs a warning and falls
       back to launching whatever's already in this folder rather than refusing to start.

.PARAMETER Launch
    After publishing, immediately run C:\Apps\KdpPublish\launch.bat.
